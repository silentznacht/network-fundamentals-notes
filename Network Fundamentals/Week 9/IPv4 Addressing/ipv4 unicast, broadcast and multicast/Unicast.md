Unicast transmission refers to one device sending a message to one other device in one-to-one communications.

A unicast packet has a destination IP address that is a unicast address which goes to a single recipient. A source IP address can only be a unicast address, because the packet can only originate from a single source. This is regardless of whether the destination IP address is a unicast, broadcast or multicast.
