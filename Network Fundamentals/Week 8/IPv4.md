**IPv4 Packet Header** 
- IPv4 is one of the primary network layer communication protocols. The IPv4 packet header is used to ensure that this packet is delivered to its next stop on the way to its destination end device.
	- An IPv4 packet header consists of fields containing important information about the packet. These fields contain binary numbers which are examined by the Layer 3 process.

- IPv4 is a **32-bit addressing system** that identifies devices on a network. It is **connectionless** and **best-effort**, meaning it just tries to deliver packets without guaranteeing success. Routers use the **destination IP address** to forward packets between networks, while subnet masks determine which devices are “local” or must be sent to a gateway.
