IP (Internet Protocol) is designed to deliver a packet from a source to a destination across one or more networks. At the data link layer (Layer 2), switches handle traffic within a single network by checking devicesâ€™ MAC addresses, referencing the MAC address table, and forwarding data to the correct port. In contrast, the network layer (Layer 3) uses IP addresses to ensure packets are sent from a device in one network to a device in another network.
