## **IPv4 Header – Simplified**

IPv4 headers are basically a bunch of fields that help routers deliver packets across networks. Here's the essentials: 

| Field                 | Purpose / Plain English                                                               |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Version               | Always 4 for IPv4. Tells routers this is IPv4.                                        |
| IHL (Header Length)   | How long the header is. Usually 20 bytes unless there are options.                    |
| Type of Service (TOS) | Prioritization info (like “this packet is urgent”). Often ignored.                    |
| Total Length          | Total size of the packet (header + data).                                             |
| Identification        | Unique number to help reassemble fragmented packets.                                  |
| Flags                 | Controls fragmentation. 3 bits: 1 reserved, DF (Don’t Fragment), MF (More Fragments). |
| Fragment Offset       | Where this fragment fits if packet was split.                                         |
| TTL (Time to Live)    | How many hops before packet dies. Prevents infinite loops.                            |
| Protocol              | Says what’s inside (TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.).                                            |
| Header Checksum       | Error check for header only.                                                          |
| Source IP             | Where packet came from.                                                               |
| Destination IP        | Where packet is going.                                                                |
| Options               | Optional, rarely used.                                                                |
**TL;DR:** Most of this is just **“where it came from, where it’s going, how big it is, and how to handle fragmentation”**.

## **IPv6 Header – Simplified**

IPv6 is way cleaner; they hated extra stuff and made it simpler. Fields are mostly **fixed size**:

| Field               | Purpose / Plain English                                                    |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Version             | Always 6 for IPv6.                                                         |
| Traffic Class       | Like Type of Service in IPv4 (priority info).                              |
| Flow Label          | Optional; helps routers treat some flows specially (like video streaming). |
| Payload Length      | Size of data **after header**.                                             |
| Next Header         | Like IPv4 Protocol field: tells what’s inside (TCP, UDP, etc.).            |
| Hop Limit           | Same as TTL in IPv4.                                                       |
| Source Address      | Where packet came from.                                                    |
| Destination Address | Where packet is going.                                                     |
**TL;DR:** IPv6 is just **“version, priority, size, type, hop limit, source, destination”**. They got rid of fragmentation fields and header checksum to simplify routing.

### **Key Differences You Actually Need to Know**

1. **IPv4 is messy**: fragmentation fields, checksum, options. IPv6 is cleaner.
2. **IPv6 addresses are huge**: 128-bit vs 32-bit for IPv4.
3. **IPv6 doesn’t need header checksum**: Routers don’t have to recalc it at each hop → faster.
4. **Fragmentation**: IPv4 can fragment in routers; IPv6 fragments at source only.
5. **Simpler headers → faster routing** in IPv6.
