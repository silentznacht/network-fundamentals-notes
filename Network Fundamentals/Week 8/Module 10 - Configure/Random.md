**1. Console Access (physical)**

- You **physically connect** a computer to the router using a console cable.
- Works even if the router’s network interfaces are down.
- **Pros:** Always works, doesn’t rely on the network.
- **Cons:** You must be physically at the device — not practical for managing multiple routers or devices far away.
    

**2. VTY (remote) access**

- Allows you to log in **over the network** using **Telnet or SSH**.
- You **don’t need to be physically near the router**.
- **Pros:** Convenient for managing devices remotely, scalable for multiple routers.
- **Cons:** Requires the router to have a working IP address and network connectivity. Telnet is insecure; SSH is secure.
