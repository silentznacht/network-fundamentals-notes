**File Transfer Protocol(FTP)->** A standard network protocol used for transferring file between a client and a server. FTP operates on a client server model, which means the client initiates a connection to the server to upload or download files.
	- FTP supports anonymous access where users don't need credentials and authenticated access which requires a username and password.
	- Although widely used for file sharing, it lacks encryption making it less secure for transferring sensitive data.
