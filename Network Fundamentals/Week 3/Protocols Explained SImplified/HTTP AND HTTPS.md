- **Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)** - This protocol governs the way a web server and a web client interact. HTTP defines the content and formatting of the requests and responses that are exchanged between the client and server. Both the client and the web server software implement HTTP as part of the application. HTTP relies on other protocols to govern how the messages are transported between the client and server.
	- **Essentially** a client (your broswer) request resources or information like HTML pages, images or content to a server, and the server responds to the request with the resources.


- **HTTPS ->** HTTP but with an extra layer of encryption which uses SSL and TLS
