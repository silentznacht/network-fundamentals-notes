**Domain Name System(DNS)→** The internet’s phone book. It translates human-readable domain names (like `google.com`) into computer-readable IP addresses (like `172.217.160.142`), so your device and router know which server to contact.

**Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)->** DHCP is a network protocol that automatically assigns IP addresses and other network configurations to devices on a network. So that they may communicate effectively.

	- When a device connects to a network, the DHCP server dynamically assigns an availble IP address from a predefined range along with details such as the subnet mask, default gateway and DNS server.
	- This simplifies network managment by eliminating the need for manual ip address configuration.
