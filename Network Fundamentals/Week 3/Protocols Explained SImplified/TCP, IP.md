**Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol ->** TCP/IP is a foundational suite of protocols that underpins most modern networks, including the internet. 
		- TCP/IP enables reliable data transmission by breaking data into packets, ensuring that they arrive in order, and handling any errors that occur during transmission.
		- The **IP** part of the suite handles addressing, and routing, ensuring packets reach their correct destination across diverse networks.
		- Together TCP/IP facilitates robust scalable and efficient communication between devices, making it essential for  network connectivity and internet functionality.

**TCP/IP â†’** TCP ensures reliable communication by breaking data into segments, assigning sequence numbers, and reassembling them correctly at the destination. IP handles addressing (assigning source and destination IPs) and routing (delivering data across networks). Routing protocols such as OSPF help find efficient paths for packets, while IP forwards them along those paths. Together, TCP/IP provides a scalable and reliable framework for communication across diverse networks.
