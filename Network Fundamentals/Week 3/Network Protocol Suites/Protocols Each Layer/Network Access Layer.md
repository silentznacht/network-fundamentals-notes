**Network Access Layer**

Address Resolution

- **ARP** - Address Resolution Protocol. Provides dynamic address mapping between an IPv4 address and a hardware address.
    
    **Note:** You may see other documentation state that ARP operates at the Internet Layer (OSI Layer 3). However, in this course we state that ARP operates at the Network Access layer (OSI Layer 2) because it's primary purpose is the discover the MAC address of the destination. A MAC address is a Layer 2 address.
    

Data Link Protocols

- **Ethernet** - Defines the rules for wiring and signaling standards of the network access layer.
- **WLAN** - Wireless Local Area Network. Defines the rules for wireless signaling across the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz radio frequencies.
