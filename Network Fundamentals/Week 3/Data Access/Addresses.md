The network and data link layers are responsible for delivering the data from the source device to the destination device. As shown in the figure, protocols at both layers contain a source and destination address, but their addresses have different purposes:

- **Network layer source and destination addresses** - Responsible for delivering the IP packet from the original source to the final destination, which may be on the same network or a remote network.
- **Data link layer source and destination addresses** - Responsible for delivering the data link frame from one network interface card (NIC) to another NIC on the same network.![[Screenshot 2025-08-29 at 22-41-50 Cisco Networking Academy NETWORK FUNDAMENTALS (CET1600C - Fall 2025).png]]
