In networking, sequencing solves the problem of segments arriving out of order. When a large message is broken into smaller segments, those pieces may travel different routes across the network and reach the receiver mixed up. To fix this, each segment is given a sequence number so the receiver can put them back in the correct order before reassembling the original message. TCP handles this sequencing process, ensuring that even if the data arrives jumbled, it is properly sorted. If a segment never arrives at all, TCP detects the gap and requests the sender to retransmit it, guaranteeing that the final message is both complete and in the right order.

Sequencing in networking is like sending a long letter that must be split into many smaller envelopes because one envelope canâ€™t hold it all. Each envelope gets a number so the person receiving them knows what order to put them in, even if they arrive mixed up. In the same way, when large messages are broken into smaller segments for transmission, TCP assigns sequence numbers to each piece. This ensures that, no matter the order in which the segments arrive, they can be reassembled correctly into the original message at the destination.
