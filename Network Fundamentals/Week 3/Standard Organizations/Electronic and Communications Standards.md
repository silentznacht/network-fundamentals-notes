Other standards organizations have responsibilities for promoting and creating the electronic and communication standards used to deliver the IP packets as electronic signals over a wired or wireless medium.

These standard organizations include the following:

- **Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers**(**IEEE**, pronounced “I-triple-E”) - Organization of electrical engineering and electronics dedicated to advancing technological innovation and creating standards in a wide area of industries including power and energy, healthcare, telecommunications, and networking. Important IEEE networking standards include 802.3 Ethernet and 802.11 WLAN standard. Search the internet for other IEEE network standards.
- **Electronic Industries Alliance (EIA)** - Organization is best known for its standards relating to electrical wiring, connectors, and the 19-inch racks used to mount networking equipment.
- **Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA)** - Organization responsible for developing communication standards in a variety of areas including radio equipment, cellular towers, Voice over IP (VoIP) devices, satellite communications, and more.
- **International Telecommunications Union-Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T)** - One of the largest and oldest communication standards organizations. The ITU-T defines standards for video compression, Internet Protocol Television (IPTV), and broadband communications, such as a digital subscriber line (DSL).
