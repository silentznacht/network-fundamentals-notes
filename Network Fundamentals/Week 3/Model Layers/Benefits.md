You cannot actually watch real packets travel across a real network, the way you can watch the components of a car being put together on an assembly line. so, it helps to have a way of thinking about a network so that you can imagine what is happening. A model is useful in these situations.

Complex concepts such as how a network operates can be difficult to explain and understand. For this reason, a layered model is used to modularize the operations of a network into manageable layers.

These are the benefits of using a layered model to describe network protocols and operations:

- Assisting in protocol design because protocols that operate at a specific layer have defined information that they act upon and a defined interface to the layers above and below
- Fostering competition because products from different vendors can work together
- Preventing technology or capability changes in one layer from affecting other layers above and below
- Providing a common language to describe networking functions and capabilities

As shown in the figure, there are two layered models that are used to describe network operations:

- Open System Interconnection (OSI) Reference Model
- TCP/IP Reference Model![[Screenshot 2025-08-29 at 16-09-10 Cisco Networking Academy NETWORK FUNDAMENTALS (CET1600C - Fall 2025).png]]
