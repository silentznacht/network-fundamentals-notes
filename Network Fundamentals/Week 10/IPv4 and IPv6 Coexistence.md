**Dual Stack**
- Dual stack allows IPv4 and IPv6 to co exist on the same network segment. Dual stack devices run both IPv4 and IPv6 protocol stacks simultaneously. 


Note: Known as native IPv6, this means the customer network has an IPv6 connection to ISP and is able to access content found on the internet over IPv6.


**Tunneling**
- Tunneling is a method of transporting an IPv6 packet over an IPv4 network. The IPv6 packet is encapsulated inside an IPv4 packet.

**Translation**
- Network Address Translation 64 (NAT64) allows IPv6 enable devices to communicate with IPv4 enabled devices using a translation technique similar to NAT for IPv4. An IPv6 packet is translated to an IPv4 packet and an IPv4 packet is translated to an IPv6 packet.
