As you have learned, fiber-optic cabling is the other type of cabling used in networks. Because it is **expensive, it is not as commonly used at the various types of copper cabling.** But fiber-optic cabling has certain properties that make it the best option in certain situations, which you will discover in this topic.

**Optical fiber cable transmits data over longer distances and at higher bandwidths than any other networking media.** Unlike copper wires, fiber-optic cable can transmit signals with **less attenuation and is completely immune to EMI and RFI.** Optical fiber is commonly used to interconnect network devices.

Optical fiber is a flexible, but extremely thin, transparent strand of very pure glass, not much bigger than a human hair. **Bits are encoded on the fiber as light impulses**. The fiber-optic cable acts as a **waveguide, or “light pipe,” to transmit light between the two ends with minimal loss of signal.**![[Screenshot 2025-09-06 at 14-08-22 Cisco Networking Academy NETWORK FUNDAMENTALS (CET1600C - Fall 2025).png]]

One of the highlighted differences between MMF and SMF is the amount of dispersion. Dispersion refers to the spreading out of a light pulse over time. Increased dispersion means increased loss of signal strength. MMF has a greater dispersion than SMF. That is why MMF can only travel up to 500 meters before signal loss.
