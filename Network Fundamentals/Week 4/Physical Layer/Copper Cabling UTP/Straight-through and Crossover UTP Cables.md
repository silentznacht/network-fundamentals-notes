**Ethernet Straight-through** - The most common type of networking cable. It is commonly used to interconnect a host to a switch and a switch to a router.

**Ethernet Crossover** - **A cable used to interconnect similar devices.** For example, to connect a **switch to a switch, a host to a host, or a router to a router**. However, crossover cables are now considered legacy as NICs use medium-dependent interface crossover (auto-MDIX) to automatically detect the cable type and make the internal connection.![[Screenshot 2025-09-06 at 13-07-45 Cisco Networking Academy NETWORK FUNDAMENTALS (CET1600C - Fall 2025).png]]
