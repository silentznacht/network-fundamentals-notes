Cables are placed into categories based on their ability to carry higher bandwidth rates. For example, Category 5 cable is used commonly in 100BASE-TX Fast Ethernet installations. Other categories include Enhanced Category 5 cable, Category 6, and Category 6a.

Cables in higher categories are designed and constructed to support higher data rates. As new gigabit speed Ethernet technologies are being developed and adopted, Category 5e is now the minimally acceptable cable type, with Category 6 being the recommended type for new building installations

- Category 3 was originally used for voice communication over voice lines, but later used for data transmission.
- Category 5 and 5e is used for data transmission. Category 5 supports 100Mbps and Category 5e supports 1000 Mbps
- Category 6 has an added separator between each wire pair to support higher speeds. Category 6 supports up to 10 Gbps.
- Category 7 also supports 10 Gbps.
- Category 8 supports 40 Gbps.![[Screenshot 2025-09-06 at 12-07-51 Cisco Networking Academy NETWORK FUNDAMENTALS (CET1600C - Fall 2025).png]]
