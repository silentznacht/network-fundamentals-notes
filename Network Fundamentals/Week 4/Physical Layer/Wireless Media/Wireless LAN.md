A common wireless data implementation is enabling devices to connect wirelessly via a LAN. In general, a WLAN requires the following network devices:

- **Wireless Access Point (AP)** - These concentrate the wireless signals from users and connect to the existing copper-based network infrastructure, such as Ethernet. Home and small business wireless routers integrate the functions of a router, switch, and access point into one device, as shown in the figure.
- **Wireless NIC adapters** - These provide wireless communication capability to network hosts.

As the technology has developed, a number of WLAN Ethernet-based standards have emerged. When purchasing wireless devices, ensure compatibility and interoperability.

The benefits of wireless data communications technologies are evident, especially the savings on costly premises wiring and the convenience of host mobility. Network administrators must develop and apply stringent security policies and processes to protect WLANs from unauthorized access and damage.
