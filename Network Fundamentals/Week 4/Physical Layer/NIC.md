**Wireless local area network (WLAN) NICs** are used for wireless. An end-user device may include one or both types of NICs. A network printer, for example, may only have an Ethernet NIC, and therefore, must connect to the network using an Ethernet cable. Other devices, such as tablets and smartphones, might only contain a WLAN NIC and must use a wireless connection.

**Not all physical connections are equal, in terms of the performance level, when connecting to a network.**
