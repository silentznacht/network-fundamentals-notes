SATA (Serial Advanced Technology Attachment or Serial ATA), pronounced “_say_-ta,” is an interface standard used mostly by storage devices. To attach a SATA drive to a motherboard, you need a data connection to the motherboard and a power connection to the power supply. Figure 2-18 shows a motherboard with seven SATA connectors. Six use the SATA Revision 3 standard, and one is a shorter SATA Express connector![[Screenshot 2025-08-30 at 23-22-35 MindTap - Cengage Learning.png]]
