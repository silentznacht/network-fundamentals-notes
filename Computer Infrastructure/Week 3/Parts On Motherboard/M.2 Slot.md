The M.2 connector or slot was first used on laptops and is now common on desktop motherboards. It is commonly used by wireless cards and solid-state drives (SSDs). When the PCIe interface is used, the slot is faster than all the SATA standards normally used by hard drives; therefore, the M.2 slot is often the choice to support the SSD that will hold the Windows installation. However, before installing Windows on an M.2 drive, make sure the motherboard BIOS/UEFI firmware will boot from an M.2 device. (Look for the option in the boot priority order in BIOS/UEFI setup, which is discussed later in this module.) Some motherboards have a cover over an M.2 slot. Figure 2-20 shows documentation in the motherboardâ€™s user manual with instructions on how to remove this cover to install the M.2 card![[Screenshot 2025-08-30 at 23-21-51 MindTap - Cengage Learning.png]]
