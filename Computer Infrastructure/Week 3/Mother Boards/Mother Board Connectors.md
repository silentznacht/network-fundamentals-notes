**Central Processing Unit (CPU) Sockets** 
	- CPU Sockets are usually the largest connector on a motherboard
	- It's in the middle because the memory slots above it,  expansions cards to the right of it, and other components all communicating to it.
	- Because both the motherboard and cpu are so closely engineered, it is a component you would upgrade later.

**Zero Insertion Force (ZIF) Socket**
-Full of little holes, that will matched with the CPU
-Has arm that you will lift up, place the CPU into the socket, and replace the arm
-All those holes in CPU Socket will be matching pins on the CPU itself. This is called a Pin Gray Array (PGA), and this will plug into a ZIF socket.

**Land Grid Array  (LGA)**
-LGA is a reverse PGA because pins are on the motherboard, while the CPU itself is completely flat on the bottom. Which means you don't have to worry about bending the CPU pins.

**Storage Drive Interfaces - SATA**

These connectors are used to connect the motherboard, to several individual storage devices.
