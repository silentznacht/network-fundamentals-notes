### **Power Supplies**

- Wattage rule: add component power needs + ~30% buffer (like you said).
    
- Connectors:
    
    - 24-pin → motherboard main power
        
    - 8-pin (or 4+4) → CPU power
        
    - 6/8-pin PCIe → graphics card
        
    - SATA power → SSD/HDD
        
    - Molex → legacy fans/older drives  
        ➡️ PSU issues cause **weird crashes, reboots, or no power at all**

### **Storage**

- HDD = spinning, slow, cheap.
    
- SATA SSD = faster, but capped by SATA speed.
    
- NVMe (M.2) = crazy fast, plugs into M.2 slot.  
    ➡️ Think: floppy → HDD → SSD → NVMe = speed evolution.
