A capture card is a peripheral device or an expansion card used to record and stream content from an external device, such as a gaming console or webcam. Capture cards are primarily used by video game streamers. Some capture cards use a PCIe port on the motherboard.


Another type of capture card is a peripheral device that connects to the computer using a USB, USB-C, or Thunderbolt port. Capture cards have a passthrough between the source of content (e.g., a gaming console or camera) and the display, typically using HDMI in/out connections. The data is sent via the passthrough to the computer to record and stream (see Figure 6-29). Some capture cards also offer ports for input from a microphone and output to a headset.

After installing a capture card, you can download and use the proprietary software that comes with the card, or you can choose third-party software. Third-party software is usually more robust than proprietary software offered by the manufacturer. Windows 10 offers Xbox Game Bar for recording (see Figure 6-30). To open Microsoft Xbox Game Bar, press the **Windows key**+**G**.
