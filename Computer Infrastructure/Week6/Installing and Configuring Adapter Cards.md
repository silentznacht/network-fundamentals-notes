These types of cards include video cards, sound cards, network interface cards (NIC), capture cards, and USB expansion cards. The purpose of adding an adapter card to a system is to add external ports or internal connectors the card provides.

Steps to Know

- **Verify that the card fits an empty expansion slot.** Recall that there are several PCI and PCI Express standards; therefore, make sure the card will fit the slot. To help with airflow, try to leave an empty slot between cards. Especially try to leave an empty slot beside the video card, which puts off a lot of heat. PCIe slots on a motherboard might support different PCIe standards. The motherboard manual tells you which slot is rated for which PCIe standard.
    
- **Verify that the device drivers for your OS are available.** Check the card documentation, and make sure you have the drivers for your OS. For example, you need to install 64-bit Windows 10 device drivers in a 64-bit installation of Windows 10. You might find drivers to download for your OS from the website of the card manufacturer.
    
- **Back up important data that is not already backed up.** Before you open the computer case, be sure to back up important data on the hard drive.
    
- **Know your starting point.** Know what works and what doesn’t work on the system. Can you connect to the network and the Internet, print, and use other installed adapter cards without errors? After installing a new card, verify your starting point again before installing another card.

### **Installing and Configuring Adapter Cards – Study Steps**

**Core Objectives:**

1. Install and configure laptop hardware and components.
    
2. Compare display components of mobile devices.
    
3. Install and configure motherboards, CPUs, and add-on cards.
    

**Purpose of Adapter Cards:**

- Add external ports or internal connectors to a system.
    
- Examples: video cards, sound cards, network interface cards (NIC), capture cards, USB expansion cards.
    

**Preparation Before Installing a Card:**

1. **Verify slot compatibility:** Make sure the card fits an empty PCI or PCIe slot. Leave an empty slot between cards for airflow, especially next to a video card. Check the motherboard manual for PCIe standards per slot.
    
2. **Check device drivers:** Ensure drivers are available for your OS (e.g., 64-bit drivers for 64-bit Windows).
    
3. **Back up important data:** Always back up data before opening the case.
    
4. **Know your starting point:** Test existing hardware and connections before installation.
    

**Steps to Install an Adapter Card:**

1. **Read the card documentation:** Follow the manufacturer’s instructions; some cards require drivers before installation.
    
2. **Disable onboard ports if replacing them:** Access BIOS/UEFI and turn off the onboard port if necessary.
    
3. **Prepare for installation:** Wear an ESD strap, shut down the system, unplug all power and cables, press the power button to drain remaining power, and remove the case cover.
    
4. **Locate the slot:** Remove any faceplate cover and screws. Save the screw for later.
    
5. **Insert the card:** Remove it from the antistatic bag and insert straight into the expansion slot without rocking. For PCIe ×16 slots, ensure the retention mechanism is properly engaged.
    
6. **Secure the card:** Use the screw to anchor the card to the case. This prevents it from loosening over time.
    
7. **Connect any power or data cables:** Example: video cards may need a 6-pin or 8-pin PCIe power connector. If the PSU lacks the connector, use a 4-pin Molex → PCIe adapter.
    
8. **Check connections and close the case:** Optionally, leave the case open until testing. Plug in external power and essential peripherals.
    
9. **Start the system:** Windows should detect new hardware and attempt automatic driver installation.
    
10. **Install drivers:** Use the manufacturer’s CD or download the latest drivers. Follow the setup program instructions. For 32-bit drivers not certified by Microsoft, allow installation if obtained from a trusted source.
    
11. **Restart and configure:** After installation, restart if prompted, configure the card as needed, and verify functionality via Device Manager. Re-seat the card if errors occur.
    

**Key Tip:**

- Always read the card’s user guide to understand hardware/software requirements and supported peripherals before installation.
