A laptop does not contain the normal PCI Express or PCI slots found in desktop systems. Many laptops provide Mini PCI Express slots (also called Mini PCIe slots) that use the PCI Express standards applied to laptops. Mini PCI Express slots use 52 pins on the edge connector. These slots can be used by many kinds of Mini PCIe cards. These cards are often used to enhance communications options for a laptop, including Wi-Fi wireless, video, and Bluetooth Mini PCIe cards.

The half-size Mini PCIe wireless Wi-Fi card shown in Figure 6-33 has two antennas. To remove the card, first disconnect the black and the gray antenna wires, and remove the one screw shown in the photo. Note the black and white triangles labeled with a 1 and a 2 on the label of the card so you know which wire goes on which connector when replacing the card. Typically, the black antenna wire goes to the black triangle, and the gray antenna wire goes with the white triangle. Then slide the card forward and out of the slot. You can then install a new card.

**Simplified**

**Mini PCIe cards** are essentially the same as standard PCIe cards but in a smaller form factor designed for laptops. They use the same PCIe interface and communicate over PCIe lanes with the CPU, just like full-size desktop cards. You can install different types of cards in a Mini PCIe slot, such as Wi-Fi adapters, cellular modems, or SSDs, as long as the card and laptop support the form factor. However, the number of slots in a laptop is limited by its physical design, so most laptops only allow one or two Mini PCIe/M.2 cards. Functionally, each card operates the same way as a desktop PCIe card, relying on the OS drivers to manage communication with the system.
