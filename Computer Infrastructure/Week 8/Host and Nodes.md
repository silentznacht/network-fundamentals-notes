- A host is a computer that can be either the client or the server using client/server applications.
    
- A node is any computer, printer, smart thermostat, or other networked device that can be addressed on the network. Every host is a node, but not every node is a host.
	- The key difference is that, a **node** is any device on a network, while a **host** is a type of **node** that can send and receive data, run applications, and provide services.
